            <p>
                In my short time as a software engineer, I have learned to develop quickly, learning new skills. programming languages, problem-solving, and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing code.Experienced on Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, and Javascript, React, and Redux. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.

                Yet we never finish learning and thereâ€™s certainly more to learn, more problems to solve, and more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
